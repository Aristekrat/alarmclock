The Alarmclock
==============

This is a mini-project I built to showcase my front-end skills. 
You should be able to download and spawn it locally without any problems. 

The alarm clock uses advanced CSS3, jQuery, jQueryUI, and web workers. 

To bring it to life, I had to overcome a couple of challenges, such as 
handling the conversion from minutes to hours, ensuring all functions 
performed appropriately regardless of the setting, rounding the hours 
in the display yet yielding correct calculations, and managing many 
related pieces of functionality. 

The javascript file in particular would likely be very interesting 
for anyone looking to assess my javascript skills.
